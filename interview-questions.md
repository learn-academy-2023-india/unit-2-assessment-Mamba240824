# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: providing an example can help communicate your point if you struggle with the vocabulary.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:L.R. 

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer:A parameter is what you would put inside the parenthesis when making a declaration and an arguement is the actual value assigned to those parameters when that function is called. 

Researched answer:A parameter is a variable in the function or method declaration, representing the input that the function expects.
An argument is the actual value or expression passed to the function or method when it is called, fulfilling the parameters' requirements.

2. What is the difference between an object and a class?

Your answer:A class is like a blueprint that will instruct the object on what to be if not already given. 

Researched answer:A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects.
An object is an instance of a class, representing a specific occurrence with concrete values for its attributes.

3. What is iteration?

Your answer:Iteration has to do with loops and repeatedly executing a certain command until a certain `thing` is achieved. 

Researched answer:Iteration is the process of repeatedly executing a set of statements or a block of code. It allows you to perform a certain operation or a series of operations multiple times. Iteration is a fundamental concept in programming and is often associated with loops, which are structures designed for repetitive execution.

4. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?
 Wahtever is being "hoisted", is the first code thats executed regardless of where it is written in the body os that code.

Researched answer: 
Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This means that, regardless of where declarations are placed in the code, they are processed before the code is executed.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Unit

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. React State:
In React, state is a JavaScript object that represents the dynamic or mutable data in a component. State allows a component to keep track of information that can change over time and influences the rendering of the component.



2. React Props: 
Props (properties) are specialized React objects used to pass information from one component to another. Props create a unidirectional flow of data and behavior from one component down to a nested component via the component invocation. While state values are constantly updated through user interactions, props cannot be changed. They are a "read only" value.

3. JSX:
JSX is JavaScript flavored markdown that behaves very similarly to HTML. There are a couple small difference between HTML and JSX. JSX uses the syntax className rather than HTML's class to modify the look and behavior of a JSX element. This is because class is already a protected word in JavaScript. JSX is a building block of React components and what allows React to create user interfaces.
(chatGptBelow)
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript, often used with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX allows you to write HTML elements and components in a syntax similar to XML or HTML, but it is ultimately transformed into JavaScript code that React understands.
